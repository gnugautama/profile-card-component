## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap

### What I learned

This is how I set the background image:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
body {
  background-image: url("./images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
  background-position: -88% 128%, 156% -80%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

I still cannot set the circle background for the mobile.

### Useful resources

- [Background position](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp) - This helped me to set the position for the circle background.
- [Adding multiple background](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This article helped me to understand that we could add multiple background. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
